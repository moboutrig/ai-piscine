    "# Exercise 1 The neuron\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this exercise is to understand the role of a neuron and to implement a neuron.\n",
    "\n",
    "An artificial neuron, the basic unit of the neural network, (also referred to as a perceptron) is a mathematical function. It takes one or more inputs that are multiplied by values called “weights” and added together. This value is then passed to a non-linear function, known as an activation function, to become the neuron’s output.\n",
    "\n",
    "As desbribed in the article, **a neuron takes inputs, does some math with them, and produces one output**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us assume there are 2 inputs. Here are the three steps involved in the neuron:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each input is multiplied by a weight:\n",
    "    - `x1 -> x1 * w1`\n",
    "    - `x2 -> x2 * w2`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The weighted inputs are added together with a biais b:\n",
    "    - `(x1 * w1) + (x2 * w2) + b`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The sum is passed through an activation function:\n",
    "    - `y = f((x1 * w1) + (x2 * w2) + b)`\n",
    "    - The activation function is a function you know from W2DAY2 (Logistic Regression): **the sigmoid**\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "x1 = 2 , x2 = 3 , w1 = 0, w2= 1, b = 4\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Step 1: Multiply by a weight\n",
    "    - `x1 -> 2 * 0 = 0`\n",
    "    - `x2 -> 3 * 1 = 3`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Step 2: Add weigthed inputs and bias\n",
    "    - `0 + 3 + 4 = 7`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Step 3: Activation function\n",
    "    - `y = f(7) = 0.999`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Implement a the function feedforward of the class `Neuron` that takes as input the inputs (x1, x2) and that uses the attributes: the weights and the biais to return y:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Neuron:\n",
    "def __init__(self, weight1, weight2, bias):\n",
    "    self.weights_1 = weight1\n",
    "    self.weights_2 = weight2\n",
