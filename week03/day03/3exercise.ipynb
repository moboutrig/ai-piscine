    "# Exercise 3 Multi classification - Softmax\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this exercise is to learn to a neural network architecture for multi-class data. This is an important type of problem on which to practice with neural networks because the three class values require specialized handling. A multi-classification neural network uses as output layer a **softmax** layer. The **softmax** activation function is an extension of the sigmoid as it is designed to output the probabilities to belong to each class in a multi-class problem. This output layer has to contain as much neurons as classes in the multi-classification problem. This article explains in detail how it works.\n",
