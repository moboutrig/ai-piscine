    "# Exercice 6 Plotly 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Plotly has evolved a lot in the previous years. It is important to **always check the documentation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plotly comes with a high level interface: Plotly Express. It helps building some complex plots easily. The lesson won't detail the complex examples. Plotly express is quite interesting while using Pandas Dataframes because there are some built-in functions that leverage Pandas Dataframes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The plot output by Plotly is interactive and can also be dynamic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the exercise is to plot the price of a company. Its price is generated below.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "returns = np.random.randn(50)\n",
    "price = 100 + np.cumsum(returns)\n",
    "\n",
    "dates = pd.date_range(start='2020-09-01', periods=50, freq='B')\n",
    "df = pd.DataFrame(zip(dates, price),\n",
    "                  columns=['Date','Company_A'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using Plotly express, reproduce the plot in the image. As the data is generated randomly I do not expect you to reproduce the same line.\n",
